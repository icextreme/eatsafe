 Note:
    - When testing on one of the devices, upon app installation,
      clicking the "cancel" button still results in updated data
      (it downloaded the data in the background even though
      "cancel is pressed").

      Note that it only happens on ONE device that we tested on,
      the other devices do NOT have this problem.

    - The app camera is locked by default upon installation
      (to unlock the camera, disable location permission)
